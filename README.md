# Reformatting an old website

[Referbished website](The%20Inner%20Product.html)

I found an old article that was cited on Wikipedia. Since this website was made
in 2004, its formatting does not fit with current HTML and CSS guidelines.
I decided, to learn HTML and CSS, to reformat it with modern website standards.

The original website, for comparison, can be found
[here](http://number-none.com/product/Understanding%20Slerp,%20Then%20Not%20Using%20It/).

Should the link no longer work, the original contents can be found
[here](original/The%20Inner%20Product%20Original.html).
